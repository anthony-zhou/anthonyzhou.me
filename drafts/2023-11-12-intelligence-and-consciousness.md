The year is 2012, and I am sitting in fourth grade. One day early in the fall semester, my math teacher pulls me aside, along with one of my friends. As our classmates work on their assigned problems, she whispers furtively: "I know you guys are bored by the class material, so why don't you study this instead!" and hands my friend and I a book. The book is titled *I Hate Mathematics!*. Provocative! I would have called it clickbait if I had known the term by then. 

From that moment on, as 9-year-old children clutching our newfound books tight to our chests, we were officially set aside from the flow of regular kids and given the title of "gifted children."

Eight years later, as a high schooler, I wrote an article exploring the many definitions of intelligence. My goal, implicitly, was to explore what exactly that teacher saw in those two nine-year-old children -- myself and my friend -- that made her pull us aside for special treatment. Can you really tell who is "gifted," or did they simply do a couple more times tables when they were young? 

In that article, I concluded that much of what we call "intelligence" is in fact culturally determined. At the same time, there are underlying metrics, like reaction time or working memory, that seem more objective. So I urged that people interested in measuring intelligence should pursue those instead. 

On the first point -- about intelligence being culturally determined -- I still agree. As Jared Diamond has noted about living in New Guinea as a Westerner, a supposedly "intelligent" Westerner can seem quite stupid even when navigating through the rainforest, much less in actually surviving there. Hunter-gatherers in New Guinea are "on the average at least as intelligent as Europeans and Americans" (http://www.jareddiamond.org/Jared_Diamond/Guns,_Germs,_and_Steel.html). Conversely, a hunter-gatherer might struggle to pass a high school calculus test. 

But why do we care about defining intelligence at all? 

## Intelligence as a measure of meritocracy

I think this is because we care about meritocracy -- building a society where those who do the best work rise to the top. Then why do we care about meritocracy? There are two main reasons I can think of. One is that meritocracy is more fair. Those who produce better work deserve to be rewarded. The other is that it results in the best long-term outcomes for society. This is how people think about the market -- if people continually develop new products, and the best product wins, then we will develop better and better products over time, and this hypothesis has largely played out. 

So meritocracy lies at the core of modern progress. However, meritocracy must be carefully cared for, because it is often more natural for those who have much to gain more. The Bible put it well so many years ago:

> "For to every one who has will more be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away." -- Matthew 25:29.

This biblical verse, referred to in a secular context as the Matthew Effect, describes exactly the opposite of what meritocracy seeks to achieve. In the Matthew Effect, those with more friends, popularity, or wealth gain more purely due to their current status. 

Let's say we agree that the purpose of the education system is to promote meritocracy. How would we do it? 


Before standardized public education, only the wealthy could afford to have their children educated, making meritocracy impossible. Even now, people worry about programs like SAT prep classes and legacy college admissions, which stand as explicit reminders of the Matthew Effect.
