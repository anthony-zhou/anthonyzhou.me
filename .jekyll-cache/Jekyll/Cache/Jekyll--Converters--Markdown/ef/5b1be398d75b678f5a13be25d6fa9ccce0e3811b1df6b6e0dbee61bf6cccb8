I"C<p>I used to think books were like drugs. And I don’t mean normal ones like Benadryl or Tylenol–I’m talking hardcore drugs, like nicotine and cocaine. How did I come to this conclusion? Like many kids, I would often start reading a book and struggle to put it down. I would start reading <em>Percy Jackson</em> in the morning and look up to find the sun was already setting. If addiction is a behavior where dependence on a substance interferes with a person’s ability to live a full life, my younger self was a full-blown pothead, if only for books instead of weed.</p>
