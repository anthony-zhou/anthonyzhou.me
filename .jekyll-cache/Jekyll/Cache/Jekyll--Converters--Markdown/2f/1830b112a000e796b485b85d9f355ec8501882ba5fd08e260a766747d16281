<p>I used to think books were like drugs. And I don’t mean normal ones like Benadryl or Tylenol–I’m talking hardcore drugs, like nicotine and cocaine. How did I come to this conclusion? Like many kids, I would often start reading a book and struggle to put it down. I would start reading <em>Percy Jackson</em> in the morning and look up to find the sun was already setting. If addiction is a behavior where dependence on a substance interferes with a person’s ability to live a full life, my younger self was a full-blown pothead, if only for books instead of weed.</p>

<p>But I was wrong about books. They’re not addictive drugs; instead, they’re more like food. I now believe in a more holistic way of thinking about information input and output, by imagining the ideas that come into my head are like ingredients in a blender. Podcasts. Magazines. Movies. Books. <em>Kerplunk</em>. <em>BZHHHH</em>. And out comes a smoothie of new and interesting ideas. This way, books come out looking like a relatively nutritious option (at least compared to TV shows and Instagram feeds).</p>

<p>All that to say, I decided to compile a list of the books I most enjoyed reading this year. Treat this as a list of ingredients, a diverse set of raw materials that can help you achieve a result that is both tasty and nutritious (and maybe inspire you to read, too).</p>
