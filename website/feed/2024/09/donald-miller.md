This morning, I started and finished the memoir *A Million Miles in a Thousand Years: How I Learned to Live a Better Story* by Donald Miller. 

Growing up, we often hear the advice to "live a story worth telling." Miller decides to take this advice literally. His pursuit of a better story pulls him into an extreme hike, a cross-country bike ride, and a search for his long-lost father. 

Miller is good at making ordinary moments feel profound. One doesn't have to kill the Dark Lord or gather all the infinity stones to live a story worth telling. 

The idea of living a story worth telling is also one of the 27 ways to live outlined in Derek Sivers's book *How to Live* (he calls it "making memories"). It's cool to see these viewpoints fully articulated.
