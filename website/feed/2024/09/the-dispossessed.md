In *Stillness is the Key*, Ryan Holiday retells the story of Epictetus, a Stoic who owned a earthen lamp. Having earned some extra money, he upgraded to a cast iron lamp. He enjoyed it for a while, until one day a burglar broke in and stole the new lamp. At first, the loss made him distraught. Eventually, though, he realized he was happier using the earthen lamp, because then he would have nothing to be stolen and feel sad about. Only those who have nothing are truly free. 

Epictetus might find himself partial to the planet Anarres of Ursula K. Le Guin's *The Dispossessed* -- a planet on which all private property has been abolished. It's an anarchist utopia, a society that functions on the basis of mutual aid. I am sure Epictetus would have no trouble getting along with the people of Anarres.
