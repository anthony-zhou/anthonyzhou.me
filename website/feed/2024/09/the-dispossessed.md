In *Stillness is the Key*, Ryan Holiday retells the story of Epictetus, As a young adult, Epictetus (a notable Stoic) had a cheap earthen lamp that he used regularly. Once he got richer, he bought a nice cast iron lamp to replace the earthen one. 

One day, the iron lamp was stolen during his sleep. At first, he was distraught. Then, he realized that his attachment to the lamp was merely tying him down to his anxious feelings. He decided from then on to keep using his old earthen lamp.

Epictetus might find himself partial to the planet Anarres of Ursula K. Le Guin's *The Dispossessed* -- a planet on which all private property has been abolished. It's a vision of what could be if we let go of our attachment to ownership.
