Today I learned that the scaffolding in New York can [reduce consumer spending at bars and restaurants by 3.5 to 9.7%](https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/632-24/mayor-adams-releases-new-study-finding-sidewalk-sheds-scaffolding-cost-manhattan-businesses#/0) in affected areas. I think the study is purely based on correlation, so the exact numbers might not be reliable, but it's not hard to predict some causal impact at the aggregated level. 

When building owners are notified of unsafe facades, they are obligated -- rightfully -- to put up some scaffolding to protect passing pedestrians from falling rocks. Unfortunately, though, they often choose to keep the scaffolding in place rather than make the necessary repairs. I wonder if the loss of revenue caused by scaffolding translates to proportionally lower rent for those businesses, which tend to operate on razor-thin margins anyways.
