One of the biggest problems in any software engineering project is the unexpected bugs that appear when software is deployed. Hence the idea of a continuous integration, or CI, pipeline. The idea of the pipeline is to run tests in a cloud environment, which simulate the problems that might occur in real-world usage. But what happens once the CI detects a problem? Usually, a developer has to read the logs and trace back through the code to discover what the problem was. What if this last step could be performed automatically? 

Enter the idea of an automated bug-fixer, which uses large language models to identify problems from unit test outputs and automatically fix them, or bubbles them up to the developer if the problems cannot be solved automatically. We believe that such an approach can catch X% of bugs before they bubble up to the user.
