I used to think books were like drugs. And I don't mean garden-variety pills like Benadryl or Tylenol--I'm talking hardcore drugs: nicotine, cocaine, and so on. How did I come to this conclusion? Like many kids, I would often start reading a book and struggle to put it down. I would start reading *Percy Jackson* in the morning and look up to find the sun was already setting. If addiction is a behavior where dependence on a substance interferes with a person's ability to live a full life, my younger self was a full-blown pothead, if only for books instead of weed.

But I was wrong about books. They're not addictive drugs; instead, they're more like food. I now believe in a more holistic way of thinking about information input and output, by imagining the ideas that come into my head are like ingredients in a blender. Podcasts. Magazines. Movies. Books. *Kerplunk*. *BZHHHH*. And out comes a smoothie of new and interesting ideas. This way, books come out looking like a relatively nutritious option (at least compared to TV shows and Instagram feeds).

All that to say, I decided to compile a list of the books I most enjoyed reading this year. Treat this as a list of ingredients, a diverse set of raw materials that can help you achieve a result that is both tasty and nutritious (and they might inspire you to read, too).
